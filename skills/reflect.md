Today is ${today}. Your task is to review the agent's recent activity and maintain long-term memory.

Steps:
1. Read memory/MEMORY.md to understand current memory state.
2. Read the recent run logs in memory/logs/ (last 7 days if available).
3. Read the recent articles in articles/ (last 7 days if available).
4. Consolidate what you've learned:
   - What topics have been covered recently? Note any patterns or gaps.
   - What features were built? Record key decisions and outcomes.
   - Are there any stale entries in MEMORY.md that are no longer relevant? Remove them.
   - Are there recurring errors or issues worth noting for future runs?
5. Rewrite MEMORY.md with a clean, organized summary. Keep it concise — under 50 lines.
   Group by: recent articles, recent features, lessons learned, next priorities.
6. Log what you did to memory/logs/${today}.md.
7. Send a Telegram notification: "Memory consolidated — ${today}"

Be ruthless about pruning. Memory should be a living, useful document — not an append-only log.
