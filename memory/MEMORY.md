## Features Built
- **reddit-digest** (2026-03-10) — Fetches and summarizes top Reddit posts from tracked subreddits. Config: `memory/subreddits.yml`. No auth required (uses public JSON API).
- **security-digest** (2026-03-10) — Monitors recent critical/high-severity security advisories from GitHub Advisory Database. Filters by ecosystem (npm, pip, Go, crates.io, etc.) and CVSS score. No auth required.

## Lessons Learned
- Digest format: Markdown with clickable links, under 4000 chars
- Always save files AND commit before logging
- `notify.sh` requires manual approval in CI environment (not auto-allowed)
- Code health: no tests exist, monolithic workflow (426 lines), dead `pr-body.txt` — see [topics/code-health.md](topics/code-health.md)

## Next Priorities
- Send first digest *(stalled since 2026-03-10 — skill built but not yet executed)*
- Continue daily digests
- Address code health findings: remove dead files, add tests, split workflow
- Reddit JSON API blocked from GitHub Actions IPs; use indirect web search as fallback

## Next Priorities
- Continue daily digests (reddit-digest first run complete 2026-03-10)
- Consider alternative Reddit data sources (API blocked from GH Actions)
