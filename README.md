## Why this over OpenClaw?

[OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) is great if you need real-time responses and have infra to run it on. Aeon is for everything else:

- **Cheaper** — runs on GitHub Actions, free for public repos, ~$2/mo otherwise. No server.
- **Built for background tasks** — digests, monitoring, research, writing. You don't need sub-second latency for any of that.
- **Doesn't break** — no daemon to crash, no process to restart. If GitHub Actions is up, Aeon is up. Failed skill? Next cron tick retries it.
- **5-minute setup** — fork, add secrets, flip skills on. No Docker, no self-hosting, no config files beyond one YAML.

## Quick start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aaronjmars/aeon
cd aeon && ./aeon
```

Click on `http://localhost:5555` to open the dashboard in your browser. From there:

1. **Authenticate** — add your Claude API key or OAuth token
2. **Add a channel** — set up [Telegram, Discord, or Slack](#notifications) so Aeon can talk to you (and you can talk back)
3. **Pick skills** — toggle on what you want, set a schedule, and optionally set a `var` to focus each skill
4. **Push** — one click commits and pushes your config to GitHub, Actions takes it from there

You can also schedule and trigger skills by messaging Aeon directly on Telegram — just tell it what you want.

## Authentication

Set **one** of these — not both:

| Secret | What it is | Billing |
|--------|-----------|---------|
| `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` | OAuth token from your Claude Pro/Max subscription | Included in plan |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | API key from console.anthropic.com | Pay per token |

**Getting an OAuth token:**
```bash
claude setup-token   # opens browser → prints sk-ant-oat01-... (valid 1 year)
```

### Bankr Gateway (optional)

Route all Claude Code requests through [Bankr LLM Gateway](https://docs.bankr.bot/llm-gateway/overview) for multi-model access and cost optimization. Bankr routes Claude through Vertex AI (~67% cheaper for Opus) and adds access to Gemini, GPT, Kimi, and Qwen models through a single API.

**Setup:**

1. Get an API key at [bankr.bot/api](https://bankr.bot/api)
2. Top up credits at [bankr.bot/llm?tab=credits](https://bankr.bot/llm?tab=credits) (USDC, ETH, or BNKR on Base)
3. Add `BANKR_LLM_KEY` as a repo secret (value: `bk_your_key`)
4. Set the gateway provider in `aeon.yml`:

```yaml
gateway:
  provider: bankr
```

**Key Permissions:** Your API key must have **LLM Gateway** enabled at [bankr.bot/api](https://bankr.bot/api). The Read Only toggle only affects the Agent API — LLM Gateway access is always available when enabled. A key used only for LLM Gateway doesn't need Agent API enabled. See [Access Control](https://docs.bankr.bot/llm-gateway/overview) for full details.

**Available models (via Bankr):**

| Provider | Models |
|----------|--------|
| Anthropic | `claude-opus-4-6`, `claude-sonnet-4-6`, `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001` |
| Google | `gemini-3-pro`, `gemini-3-flash` |
| OpenAI | `gpt-5.2` |
| Moonshot AI | `kimi-k2.5` |
| Alibaba | `qwen3-coder` |

Non-Claude models are available in the workflow dispatch dropdown and per-skill model overrides when gateway is set to `bankr`. Set `provider: direct` (the default) to use the standard Anthropic API.

## Use with Claude (MCP)

Aeon's skills are available as tools in Claude Desktop and Claude Code via the MCP server bundled in `mcp-server/`.

```bash
./add-mcp
```

That's it. Every Aeon skill appears as an `aeon-<name>` tool in your Claude interface — no GitHub Actions required. Skills run locally via `claude -p -`, identical to how they run in Actions.

**Example usage in Claude:**

> Use the `aeon-hacker-news-digest` tool to get today's top HN stories

> Run `aeon-deep-research` with `var="AI agent frameworks"` and write a summary

> Use `aeon-token-movers` to get today's top crypto movers

**Options:**

| Flag | Effect |
|------|--------|
| `./add-mcp` | Build and register with Claude Code |
| `./add-mcp --desktop` | Also print Claude Desktop config snippet |
| `./add-mcp --build-only` | Build without registering (CI use) |
| `./add-mcp --uninstall` | Remove the MCP server |

Skills that need API keys (CoinGecko, Alchemy, etc.) read from the same environment variables they use in Actions — set them in your shell or a `.env` file in the repo root. Notification channels (Telegram, Discord, Slack) are optional; if not set, output is returned directly to Claude.

---

## Use with any AI agent (A2A)

Aeon implements [Google's Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol](https://google.github.io/A2A/), making all skills accessible to any A2A-compliant agent framework — LangChain, AutoGen, CrewAI, OpenAI Agents SDK, Vertex AI — without needing Claude or MCP.

```bash
./add-a2a
```

The gateway starts an HTTP server (default port `41241`) that advertises all Aeon skills via the A2A agent card endpoint and accepts task invocations via JSON-RPC.

**Discovery endpoint** — fetch this to see all available skills:

```
GET http://localhost:41241/.well-known/agent.json
```

**Invoke a skill** (Python example with any A2A-compatible HTTP client):

```python
import requests, uuid

# Send task
task = requests.post("http://localhost:41241/", json={
    "jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 1, "method": "tasks/send",
    "params": {
        "id": str(uuid.uuid4()),
        "skillId": "aeon-deep-research",
        "var": "AI agent frameworks 2025",
        "message": {"role": "user", "parts": [{"type": "text", "text": "Run aeon-deep-research"}]}
    }
}).json()

task_id = task["result"]["id"]  # poll with tasks/get or use SSE streaming
```

**SSE streaming** for long-running skills (`deep-research`, `last30`):

```bash
curl -N -X POST http://localhost:41241/tasks/sendSubscribe \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"tasks/send","params":{"skillId":"aeon-hacker-news-digest"}}'
```

**Options:**

| Flag | Effect |
|------|--------|
| `./add-a2a` | Build and start on port 41241 |
| `./add-a2a --port 8080` | Use a custom port |
| `./add-a2a --build-only` | Build without starting (CI use) |
| `./add-a2a --print-config` | Print LangChain/Python client examples |

**A2A endpoints:**

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `/.well-known/agent.json` | GET | Agent card — lists all skills |
| `/` | POST | JSON-RPC: `tasks/send`, `tasks/get`, `tasks/cancel` |
| `/tasks/sendSubscribe` | POST | SSE streaming for async skill output |

Run `./add-a2a --print-config` for ready-to-paste LangChain tool wrappers and Python polling examples.

## GitHub Pages Gallery

Aeon publishes articles to a browsable gallery via GitHub Pages. After merging, enable it in **Settings → Pages** → source `Deploy from a branch`, branch `main`, folder `/docs`.

The gallery will be live at `https://<username>.github.io/aeon`.

The site includes three sections:
- **Articles** — published content from content-generating skills
- **Activity** (`/activity/`) — daily log of everything Aeon does: skills run, files created, notifications sent
- **Memory** (`/memory/`) — current goals, active topics, and topic deep-dives synced from `memory/`

The `update-gallery` skill syncs `articles/*.md` → `docs/_posts/` with proper Jekyll frontmatter on a weekly schedule. Site data (logs, memory, topics) is synced via `scripts/sync-site-data.sh`. Enable `update-gallery` in `aeon.yml` to keep the gallery up to date automatically.

---

## RSS Feed

Subscribe to Aeon's article output via Atom feed:

```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/<owner>/<repo>/main/articles/feed.xml
```

Add this URL to any RSS reader (Feedly, Miniflux, NetNewsWire, etc.) to get new articles as they're published. The feed is regenerated daily or after each content-generating skill runs.

---

## Heartbeat

The only skill enabled by default. Runs every 3 hours as a fallback catch-all.

Every run: reads recent memory and logs, checks for stalled PRs (>24h), flagged memory items, urgent issues, and skills that haven't run on schedule. Deduplicates against the last 48h of logs — it won't re-notify you about something it already flagged.

Nothing to report → logs `HEARTBEAT_OK`, exits, no commit. Something needs attention → sends a concise notification.

Heartbeat is listed last in `aeon.yml` so it only runs when no other skill claims the slot.

---

## Quality scoring & self-healing

Every skill output is automatically scored 1–5 by a lightweight model (Haiku) after each run:

| Score | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 1 | Failed / empty / error output |
| 2 | Ran but low quality, generic, or boilerplate |
| 3 | Acceptable — completed the task adequately |
| 4 | Good — substantive, well-structured, useful |
| 5 | Excellent — insightful, well-sourced, actionable |

Scores and flags (e.g. `api_error`, `stale_data`, `rate_limited`) are tracked per skill in `memory/skill-health/<skill>.json` with a rolling 30-run history. The `skill-health` skill reads these files to surface trends and detect degradation.

### Self-healing loop

Aeon monitors its own health and can auto-repair failing skills:

1. **`heartbeat`** (3x daily) — checks `memory/cron-state.json` for failed, stuck, or chronically broken skills
2. **`skill-health`** — audits quality scores and flags API degradation patterns across skills
3. **`skill-evals`** — runs assertion-based output quality tests to catch regressions
4. **`skill-repair`** — diagnoses root causes and patches failing skills automatically
5. **`self-improve`** — evolves prompts, config, and workflows based on recent performance

### Reactive triggers

Skills with `schedule: "reactive"` don't run on a cron — they fire when conditions are met:

```yaml
reactive:
  skill-repair:
    trigger:
      - { on: "*", when: "consecutive_failures >= 3" }
  autoresearch:
    trigger:
      - { on: skill-health, when: "last_status = success" }
```

The scheduler evaluates reactive rules after processing cron skills. Any matching trigger dispatches the skill (with dedup). This means if any skill fails 3 times in a row, `skill-repair` auto-fires to investigate and fix it.

### Cost tracking

Every run logs token usage (input, output, cache read, cache creation) to `memory/token-usage.csv`. The `cost-report` skill generates a weekly breakdown by skill and model with dollar cost estimates and trend analysis.

---

## Configuration

All scheduling lives in `aeon.yml`:

```yaml
skills:
  article:
    enabled: true               # flip to activate
    schedule: "0 8 * * *"       # daily at 8am UTC
  digest:
    enabled: true
    schedule: "0 14 * * *"
    var: "solana"               # topic for this skill
```

Standard cron format. All times UTC. Supports `*`, `*/N`, exact values, comma lists.

**Order matters** — the scheduler picks the first matching skill. Put day-specific skills (e.g. Monday-only) before daily ones. Heartbeat goes last.

### The `var` field

Every skill accepts a single `var` — a universal input that each skill interprets in its own way:

| Skill type | What `var` does | Example |
|-----------|----------------|---------|
| Research & content | Sets the topic | `var: "rust"` → digest about Rust |
| Dev & code | Narrows to a repo | `var: "owner/repo"` → only review that repo's PRs |
| Crypto | Focuses on a token/wallet | `var: "solana"` → only check SOL price |
| Productivity | Sets the focus area | `var: "shipping v2"` → morning brief emphasizes v2 |

If `var` is empty, each skill falls back to its default behavior (scan everything, auto-pick topics, etc.). Set it from the dashboard or pass it when triggering manually.

### Model selection

The default model for all skills is set in `aeon.yml`:

```yaml
model: claude-opus-4-6
```

You can change it from the dashboard header dropdown. Options: `claude-opus-4-6`, `claude-sonnet-4-6`, `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001`. Per-run overrides are also available via workflow dispatch.

Individual skills can override the default model to optimize cost:

```yaml
skills:
  token-report: { enabled: true, schedule: "30 12 * * *", model: "claude-sonnet-4-6" }
  skill-evals: { enabled: true, schedule: "0 6 * * 0", model: "claude-sonnet-4-6" }
```

### Skill Chaining

Skills can be chained together so outputs flow between them. Chains run as separate GitHub Actions workflow steps via `chain-runner.yml`.

```yaml
chains:
  morning-pipeline:
    schedule: "0 7 * * *"
    on_error: fail-fast       # or: continue
    steps:
      - parallel: [token-movers, hacker-news-digest]  # run concurrently
      - skill: morning-brief                         # runs after parallel group
        consume: [token-movers, hacker-news-digest]  # gets their outputs injected
```

How it works:
1. Each step runs as a separate workflow dispatch
2. After each skill completes, its output is saved to `.outputs/{skill}.md`
3. Downstream steps with `consume:` get prior outputs injected into context
4. Steps can run in parallel or sequentially
5. `on_error: fail-fast` aborts the chain on any failure; `continue` keeps going

Define chains in `aeon.yml` alongside your skills. The scheduler dispatches them on their own cron schedule.

---

### Instance Fleet

Aeon can spawn and manage copies of itself. Use this to run specialized instances — one for crypto monitoring, another for research, etc.

| Skill | What it does |
|-------|-------------|
| `spawn-instance` | Fork this repo into a new purpose-built instance with pre-selected skills |
| `fleet-control` | Health checks, skill dispatch, and status reports across all managed instances |
| `fork-fleet` | Scan community forks for interesting diverged work worth upstreaming |

**Spawning a new instance:**
```
var: "crypto-tracker: monitor DeFi protocols and token movements"
```

The skill forks the repo, selects relevant skills based on the purpose, writes a `SETUP.md` with activation instructions, and registers it in `memory/instances.json`. The new instance is inert until the owner adds their own API keys — no secrets are propagated.

**Fleet control** runs twice daily by default (9am, 3pm UTC). It checks each instance's health, flags stale or degraded instances, and can dispatch skills remotely:
```
var: "dispatch crypto-tracker token-movers"
var: "status"
```

---

### Changing check frequency

Edit `.github/workflows/messages.yml`:

```yaml
schedule:
  - cron: '*/5 * * * *'    # every 5 min (default)
  - cron: '*/15 * * * *'   # every 15 min (saves Actions minutes)
  - cron: '0 * * * *'      # hourly (most conservative)
```

Claude only installs and runs when a skill actually matches.

---

## GitHub Actions cost

| Scenario | Cost |
|----------|------|
| No skill matched (most ticks) | ~10s — checkout + bash + exit |
| Skill runs | 2–10 min depending on complexity |
| Heartbeat (nothing found) | ~2 min |
| **Public repo** | **Unlimited free minutes** |

To reduce usage: switch to `*/15` or hourly cron, disable unused skills, keep the repo public.

| Plan | Free minutes/mo | Overage |
|------|----------------|---------|
| Free | 2,000 | N/A (private only) |
| Pro / Team | 3,000 | $0.008/min |

---

## Notifications

Set the secret → channel activates. No code changes needed.

| Channel | Outbound | Inbound |
|---------|---------|---------|
| Telegram | `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` + `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID` | Same |
| Discord | `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL` | `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN` + `DISCORD_CHANNEL_ID` |
| Slack | `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL` | `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` + `SLACK_CHANNEL_ID` |
| Email | `SENDGRID_API_KEY` + `NOTIFY_EMAIL_TO` | — |

**Telegram:** Create a bot with @BotFather → get token + chat ID.  
**Discord:** Outbound: Channel → Integrations → Webhooks → Create. Inbound: discord.com/developers → bot → add `channels:history` scope → copy token + channel ID.  
**Slack:** api.slack.com → Create App → Incoming Webhooks → install → copy URL. Inbound: add `channels:history`, `reactions:write` scopes → copy bot token + channel ID.  
**Email:** sendgrid.com/settings/api_keys → Create API Key (Mail Send permission) → add as `SENDGRID_API_KEY`. Set `NOTIFY_EMAIL_TO` to your recipient address. Optional: set repository variable `NOTIFY_EMAIL_FROM` (default: `aeon@notifications.aeon.bot`) and `NOTIFY_EMAIL_SUBJECT_PREFIX` (default: `[Aeon]`).

### Telegram instant mode (optional)

Default polling has up to 5-min delay. Deploy this ~20-line Cloudflare Worker for ~1s response:

```js
export default {
  async fetch(request, env) {
    const { message } = await request.json();
    if (!message?.text || String(message.chat.id) !== env.TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID)
      return new Response("ignored");

    // Advance offset so polling doesn't reprocess
    await fetch(`https://api.telegram.org/bot${env.TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN}/getUpdates?offset=${message.update_id + 1}`);

    // Trigger GitHub Actions immediately
    await fetch(`https://api.github.com/repos/${env.GITHUB_REPO}/dispatches`, {
      method: "POST",
      headers: { Authorization: `token ${env.GITHUB_TOKEN}`, Accept: "application/vnd.github.v3+json" },
      body: JSON.stringify({ event_type: "telegram-message", client_payload: { message: message.text } }),
    });

    return new Response("ok");
  },
};
```

Set env vars (`TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`, `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID`, `GITHUB_REPO`, `GITHUB_TOKEN`) in Cloudflare dashboard, then point your bot's webhook at the worker URL.

---

## Cross-repo access

The built-in `GITHUB_TOKEN` is scoped to this repo only. For `github-monitor`, `pr-review`, `issue-triage`, and `external-feature` to work on your other repos, add a `GH_GLOBAL` personal access token.

| | `GITHUB_TOKEN` | `GH_GLOBAL` |
|--|--------------|------------|
| Scope | This repo | Any repo you grant |
| Created by | GitHub (automatic) | You (manual) |
| Lifetime | Job duration | Up to 1 year |

**Setup:** github.com/settings/tokens → Fine-grained → set repo access → grant Contents, Pull requests, Issues (all read/write) → add as `GH_GLOBAL` secret.

Skills use `GH_GLOBAL` when available, fall back to `GITHUB_TOKEN` automatically.

---

## Adding skills

### Install external skills

```bash
./add-skill BankrBot/skills --list          # browse a repo's skills
./add-skill BankrBot/skills bankr hydrex   # install specific skills
./add-skill BankrBot/skills --all           # install everything
```

Installed skills land in `skills/` and are added to `aeon.yml` disabled. Flip `enabled: true` to activate.

### Install individual skills from Aeon

Every skill in this repo is independently installable. Browse the full catalog in [`skills.json`](skills.json) or use the CLI:

```bash
# Install a single skill
./add-skill aaronjmars/aeon token-alert

# Install multiple skills
./add-skill aaronjmars/aeon token-alert monitor-polymarket hacker-news-digest

# Install everything
./add-skill aaronjmars/aeon --all

# Browse available skills
./add-skill aaronjmars/aeon --list
```

### Export a skill for distribution

Package any skill as a standalone directory (with a generated README) for sharing:

```bash
./export-skill token-alert              # exports to ./exports/token-alert/
./export-skill token-alert --tar        # also creates a .tar.gz archive
./export-skill --list                   # list all exportable skills
```

### Trigger feature builds from issues

Label any GitHub issue `ai-build` → workflow fires → Claude reads the issue, implements it, opens a PR.

## Use as GitHub Agentic Workflow

Don't need the full agent? Grab individual workflow templates and drop them into any repo. These work with [GitHub Agentic Workflows](https://github.blog/changelog/2026-02-13-github-agentic-workflows-are-now-in-technical-preview/) — plain Markdown files in `.github/workflows/` that run with any supported agent engine.

| Template | What it does | Trigger |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| [issue-triage.md](workflows/issue-triage.md) | Auto-label and prioritize new issues | On issue opened |
| [pr-review.md](workflows/pr-review.md) | Review PRs for bugs, security, and quality | On PR opened/updated |
| [changelog.md](workflows/changelog.md) | Categorized changelog from recent commits | Weekly |
| [security-digest.md](workflows/security-digest.md) | Monitor advisories for your dependencies | Daily |
| [code-health.md](workflows/code-health.md) | Audit TODOs, dead code, test gaps | Weekly |

```bash
# Copy a template into your repo
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aaronjmars/aeon/main/workflows/pr-review.md
mv pr-review.md .github/workflows/
git add .github/workflows/pr-review.md && git commit -m "Add PR review workflow"
```

Each template is self-contained Markdown — edit the trigger, criteria, or format to fit your project. See [`workflows/README.md`](workflows/README.md) for details.

## Soul (optional)

By default Aeon has no personality. To make it write and respond like you, add a soul:

1. Fork [soul.md](https://github.com/aaronjmars/soul.md) and fill in your files:
   - `SOUL.md` — identity, worldview, opinions, interests
   - `STYLE.md` — voice, sentence patterns, vocabulary, tone
   - `examples/good-outputs.md` — 10–20 calibration samples
2. Copy into your Aeon repo under `soul/`
3. Add to the top of `CLAUDE.md`:

```markdown
## Identity

Read and internalize before every task:
- `soul/SOUL.md` — identity and worldview
- `soul/STYLE.md` — voice and communication patterns
- `soul/examples.md` — calibration examples

Embody this identity in all output. Never hedge with "as an AI."
```

Every skill reads `CLAUDE.md`, so identity propagates automatically.

**Quality check:** soul files work when they're specific enough to be wrong. *"I think most AI safety discourse is galaxy-brained cope"* is useful. *"I have nuanced views on AI safety"* is not.

## Two-repo strategy

This repo is a public template. Run your own instance as a **private fork** so memory, articles, and API keys stay private.

```bash
# Pull template updates into your private fork
git remote add upstream https://github.com/aaronjmars/aeon.git
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/main --no-edit
```

Your `memory/`, `articles/`, and personal config won't conflict — they're in files that don't exist in the template.

---

## Troubleshooting

**Messages not being picked up?**

GitHub has two requirements for scheduled workflows:
1. The workflow file must be on the **default branch** — crons on feature branches don't fire.
2. The repo must have **recent activity** — GitHub disables crons on repos with no commits in 60 days. New template forks need one manual trigger to activate.

**Fix:** Actions → Messages → Run workflow (manual trigger). After that, the cron activates automatically.
